# GRaph-ADaptive Ensemble Gaussian Processes (GradEGP)

### How to run 

1. The main file for one MC run is main_EGP_run.m
2. For a given dataset and number of MC runs, one can run  EGP_res.m to obtain GradEGP results for MC runs
3. The "network delay", "temperature" and "email eu" datasets can be found at  NetDelayFeat.mat, Tempfeatdata.mat and emailEuData.mat respectively.
4. The chosen hyperparameters in the param folder for each dataset can be obtained via grid search or Python sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor package, using a sunset of the data (e.g 20%)  

Example: For the Network Delay dataset the results for 50 MC runs can be obtained running EGP_res("network delay", 50)
