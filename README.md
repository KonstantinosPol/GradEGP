# GRaph-ADaptive Ensemble Gaussian Processes (GradEGP)


### Description

A. The main file for one Monte-Carlo (MC) run is main_EGP_run.m

B. For a given dataset and number of MC runs, one can run  EGP_res.m to obtain GradEGP results for MC runs

C. The "network delay", "temperature" and "email eu" datasets can be found at  NetDelayFeat.mat, Tempfeatdata.mat and emailEuData.mat respectively.

D. The chosen hyperparameters in the param files for each dataset can be obtained via grid search or Python sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor package, using a subset of the data (e.g 20%)  

### How to run

1. For the Network Delay dataset the results for 50 MC runs can be obtained running in Matlab command window: 
 ```
  [egp_vec, time_tot_egp] =EGP_res("network delay", 50)  
 ```
2. For the Temperature dataset the results for 50 MC runs can be obtained running in Matlab command window:
 ```
   [egp_vec, time_tot_egp] =EGP_res("temperature", 50)
 ```
3. For the Email Eu dataset the results for 50 MC runs can be obtained running in Matlab command window: 
 ```
   [egp_vec, time_tot_egp] =EGP_res("email eu", 50)
 ```
